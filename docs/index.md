# Cylix Demo Overview

Welcome to the **Cylix Demo** site. This is a high-level, non-sensitive overview of the Cylix AI-driven cybersecurity and purple-team validation platform.

This page is designed for:

- Security leaders (CISO, VP of Security)
- MSSPs and MDR providers
- Red / blue / purple team leads and architects

---

## What Cylix Helps You Do

- **Continuously validate your defenses** with campaigns and simulations
- **Prioritize and investigate threats** with AI copilots and guided workflows
- **Communicate risk and coverage** clearly to executives and stakeholders

At a high level, Cylix combines:

- Campaign-based control validation and purple teaming
- Threat-centric dashboards and analytics
- AI-assisted investigation and reporting

---

## Beyond Simple Scanning

Cylix is **not** just a scanner.

It is a platform for:

- Designing and running **multi-step validation campaigns**
- Mapping activity to frameworks such as **NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK, and OWASP**
- Driving **end-to-end investigations**, from initial signal to executive summary

Where scanners typically produce raw lists of issues, Cylix focuses on:

- **Attack paths and campaign context**
- **Analyst workflows and collaboration**
- **Narrative reporting** for both technical and business audiences

---

## Deep Capabilities (Highlights)

### Campaign Builder

- Build **multi-step validation campaigns** that chain techniques and conditions
- Reuse campaigns across clients and environments
- Compare how different environments respond to the same scenarios

### Multi-Tenant MSSP Workflows

- Designed so MSSPs can manage **many tenants from a single pane of glass**
- Standardized playbooks and reports for consistent service delivery
- Visibility across tenants without exposing client data between them

### AI Playbooks & Customizable Agents

- AI-driven playbooks that help analysts:
  - Triage and prioritize alerts
  - Decide on next best investigative steps
  - Produce summaries for leadership
- Agents can be **tuned to your style** (aggressive hunting vs. conservative triage, etc.)

### Federated-Learning-Oriented Design

- Architecture oriented toward **learning from patterns** across environments while keeping tenant data isolated
- Helps MSSPs leverage cross-tenant intelligence **without sharing raw data**

### Reporting & Compliance Views

- Reporting modules for:
  - Technical detail (campaigns, evidence, timelines)
  - Executive and board-level summaries (risk, trends, coverage)
- Support for communicating **control coverage** against common frameworks
