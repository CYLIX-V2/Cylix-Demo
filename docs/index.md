## Quick tour (5 minutes)

If you're evaluating Cylix as a **one-time IP acquisition**, start with:

1. **Dashboards & Analytics screenshots** below on this page to see how XDR and mission views look.
2. **Threat & Alert Views** to understand how incidents, findings, and AI missions are presented.
3. **AI, Settings & Style** to glimpse how AI agents, custom agents, and tenant/settings views surface in the UI.
4. The main **README on GitHub** to review what assets are included in an acquisition and how the platform fits alongside your existing stack.

Then, if you're interested, use the contact information at the bottom to request the full buyer pack (architecture docs, incident case studies, readiness reports).
